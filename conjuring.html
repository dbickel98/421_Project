          <p>This movie is incredibly boring, i signed up to IMDb just so i could review this movie. I really really regret watching this at the movies, waste of money.

            The story takes so long to build up and the end result is pathetic. I don't usually watch this genre so i was expecting to be scared, there was not one scene i found scary because the movie is so predictable and who ever says this movie is scary in the slightest seriously needs to grow up. 
            
            This movie may scare children but if your above 15 years of age and your scared from this movie, i feel sorry for you.</p>

          <p>This is a movie sure to please those who fervently believe in the supernatural. All others should be warned that it will assault your intellectual sensibilities. On a technical level the cinematography and sound were certainly adequate. The acting was professional. The sets were attractive. The problem was the basic premise, the screenplay and the pedestrian special effects (perhaps these improved near the end of the film, but I was forced to abandon my viewing when the rubber ball came sailing out of the storage space).

            Really, if you are not a fan (and staunch believer) of the supernatural, save your money - or rent anything else. It will be better.
            
            Movies such as this should be forced to carry a government health warning: Caution, viewing this film my cause drooling, incredulity and momentary loss of your higher mental capabilities</p>

          <p>Are you kidding me?! This film plays like a parody of itself. It is laughable. People keep talking about it being well crafted, but that doesn't take it very far at all. After it recycles every conceivable clich√© known to the genre without any self-awareness I was exhausted. I kept thinking I was going to be let in on the joke at any minute but the scariest thing happened - it turned out that the film takes itself seriously! I can't believe people liked this garbage. That really is scary!</p><br>
