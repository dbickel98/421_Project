          <p>I knew that this movie was going to be bad, I just didn't know how bad. And I must admit that I was expecting it to be bad in an enjoyable way.

            It turned out that it wasn't so...
            
            This movie was just fundamentally bad on many levels, and there were so many things wrong with it. It was so hillarious that during the car chase scenes and the fight scenes that they just cranked up the frame rates per second which gave it all a laughable cartoonish quality, especially since everything in the background moved equally fast. And the scene where the van exploded after slowly rolling into an earthy hill was just preposterous. Then there was the scene where the driver caught on fire but it was so painstakingly clear to see that it was a different stunt guy and not the actor, and that he was fully covered in fire-proof gel. Or the scene where Joe engages with an opponent in an area where there are cacti, then as then suddenly it is a grassy area, and finally becomes a barren field with no vegetation, and they had not even moved - it just was such a horrible continuity error.
            
            The dialogue in the movie was every bit as corny as the storyline, and the acting was equally so. It was so difficult to take the actor playing the samurai cop, Mathew Karedas, serious with that hair of his.
            
            This is the type of movie you watch once and never again. And that awful sword fight scene at the end of the movie is the best thing in the entire movie, because it is so awful. And that alone is the one and only thing you really need to watch in the entire movie. The entire movie is just leading up to the climatic showdown between the hair and the chin.</p>

          <p>This is by far the funniest thing I've seen in years. Absolutely fantastic. I was crying with laughter. I'm still laughing just thinking about it. Get the DVD with the Joe Bob Briggs commentary on it (but watch the film in its raw form first). The plot doesn't make much sense, but neither does Samurai Cop's hair. Every scene has its own treasures. Frank's random facial expressions are still killing me. And when he laughs out loud - you think you've just missed the world's funniest joke. Although to be fair Samurai Cop has his own moments of gurning, usually whilst driving. Which reminds me - when Frank gets into the car for the first time - did he forget to take out the child booster seat? There are hundreds of continuity errors, but that's all part of the magic of Samurai cop. I particularly like the ever-changing fire extinguisher and the tubby guy in the white T-shirt and takes way to long to die. And keep an eye out for the exotic Lion's head which would befit any office. I best not spoil any more, and believe me there's tonnes more to enjoy. Get yourself a copy and watch it - then watch with the Joe Bob Briggs commentary. Best Â£5 I spent in a long time!</p>
