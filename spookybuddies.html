          <p>I'm gonna be honest. I had my doubts going into this movie. I had heard that this movie was a "slap in the face" to true Air Bud fans. 
            But my goodness, I was wrong. I don't even know where to start. The cinematography looked like it was shot by Roger Deakins himself.
            The score was masterfully written. It felt like a mix of a John Williams and Hans Zimmer score. Impeccable acting by the cast. 
            This masterpiece is the gold standard for film moving forward. Check the box office records for this movie because it will be taking home 
            all of the records.</p>

          <p>Make no mistake, behind its pseudo-intellectual facade this movie is just another mindless Arnold shoot'em up.
            Almost from the beginning the outcome of the movie is literally SPELLED OUT by numerous characters at numerous occasions in often lengthy and loud speeches to make sure that nobody will miss the point.
            If that is your idea of an intellectually stimulating film then "Billy Madison" or "Dude, where's my car?" are probably too.</p>

          <p>I totally love everything about this movie.

            The script one of the best ever, and is both entertaining and thought provoking all the way.
            
            The locations are really cool and futuristic both on Earth and Mars. The effects great, and CGI is only used where it fits, like the X-ray sequence. Todays sci-fi movies could learn from that, because CGI just has that artificial feel to it, no matter how many polygons it consists of.
            
            The soundtrack is very cool and atmospheric, although you might not think classical music would fit a movie like this, but it does.
            
            There might be a lot of unnecessary violence, but it's done in a funny and exaggerated way, like when Arnie says "screw you" and kills a guy with a drilling tool. The acting might not be considered good in a conventional way, but it's just an action flick, and I like the whole energy the actors put into their performance.
            
            Definitely one of the most entertaining movies of all time, and that's what really counts I think. There's too many boring movies around, especially compared to this one.</p><br>
